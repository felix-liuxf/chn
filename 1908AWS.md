### How to allow ping an AWS EC2 instance (cannot ping EC2 instance)
```
Allow ICMP inbound traffic
To solve this issue, you will need to allow specifically the Echo Request and Echo Reply protocol in the ICMP inbound traffic of your EC2 instances. 
This can be done accesing the NETWORK & SECURITY menu in the left panel of AWS.
